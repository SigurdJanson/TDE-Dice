\usage{
dSumKdN(k = 2L, n = 6L)

dSum2dN(n = 6L)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{number of dice (integer, `k > 1`)}

\item{n}{number of faces of the dice (integer, `n > 1`)}
}
\value{
A named vector with the probabilities for each sum
of dice.
}
\description{
Calculate the probability of rolling n dice with k faces.
}
\details{
For two fair n-sided dice (faces 1..n),
the sum distribution is triangular. The functions here have
been tested in a value range of n ∊ [1, 100].

For two fair n-sided dice (faces 1..n),
the sum distribution is triangular.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{dSum2dN()}: `sum2dN` is used for 2 dice because this
method is a low more efficient.
